# Selenium Signup Automation Bot

This project automates the signup process on a website using **Selenium WebDriver** in Java. It fills out the signup form with randomly generated details (username, email, password) and stores the generated credentials in a text file for later use. Additionally, it follows a user on the platform after completing the signup process.

## Features
- Automatically fills out a signup form with randomly generated username, email, and password.
- Stores the generated credentials (username and password) in a text file.
- Appends new credentials to the existing file without overwriting the old data.
- Clicks through necessary buttons and handles popups during the signup process.
- Searches for a user and clicks to follow them after signup.
- Uses **WebDriverWait** for better synchronization and performance.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, you need to have the following installed:

- **Java** (Version 8 or higher)
- **Maven** (for dependency management)
- **Selenium WebDriver** (via Maven dependencies)
- **ChromeDriver** (Make sure it's compatible with your version of Chrome browser)

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository** or download the project files.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/selenium-signup-bot.git
    ```

2. **Set up Selenium WebDriver**:
    - Download the [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/) and ensure it matches your version of Chrome.
    - Place the `chromedriver.exe` in an appropriate location on your system (e.g., `C:\Chrome WebDriver\chromedriver.exe`).

3. **Configure WebDriver path**:
    - In the `BotForSignup` class, make sure the `System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "C:\\Chrome WebDriver\\chromedriver.exe");` line points to the correct location where you saved the ChromeDriver.

4. **Add Maven Dependencies**:
    Ensure your project has the necessary Maven dependencies to run Selenium. If you are using Maven, you can add the following to your `pom.xml`:

    ```xml
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId>
            <artifactId>selenium-java</artifactId>
            <version>4.0.0</version>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId>
            <artifactId>selenium-chrome-driver</artifactId>
            <version>4.0.0</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
    ```

5. **Create a `usernames_and_passwords.txt` File**:
    - The credentials generated by the bot will be stored in a file named `usernames_and_passwords.txt` in the same directory as your project.
    - If you want to store it elsewhere, update the `FILE_PATH` in the `BotForSignup` class to reflect the new location.

## Usage

1. **Run the project**:
    - Once everything is set up, run the project via your IDE or through the command line using:

      ```bash
      mvn clean install
      mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.example.BotForSignup"
      ```

2. **Credentials Output**:
    - The bot will automatically generate a random email and username each time it runs. After signing up, these credentials will be written to `usernames_and_passwords.txt`.
    - The file will contain a list of all credentials from past runs, without overwriting any previous data.

3. **Console Output**:
    - The bot will print the generated username and password to the console during runtime for your reference.

## Example Output in `usernames_and_passwords.txt`:

Username: testuser1698523198321, Password: ABc@3456
